Portal-BBS
==========
This file is a brief introduction to the Portal-BBS project.

  For some reason, we decided to build up our own BBS system as our portal of njuopen.org. And after discussion, we decided to write it using PHP, the currently most popular server script language. This will help us develop team spirit in our social activity, as well as improve our skills in programming & software designing.
  So, here we go.
